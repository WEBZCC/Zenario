	This file contains JavaScript source code.
	The code here is not the code you see in your browser. Before thus file is downloaded:
	
		1. Compilation macros are applied (e.g. "foreach" is a macro for "for .. in ... hasOwnProperty").
		2. It is minified (e.g. using Google Closure Compiler).
		3. It may be wrapped togther with other files (thus is to reduce the number of http requests on a page).
	
	For more information, see js_minify.shell.php for steps (1) and (2), and organizer.wrapper.js.php for step (3).
